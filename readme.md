# Ephemeral

Just a basic chat application made in Rust/HTMX/AlpineJS using websockets. It's just a test and not intended for actual real world use but feel free to do what you want.

## Build

Make sure to download the [latest tailwindcss-cli 4 binrary](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v4.0.11) for your system and place it in the project root.
